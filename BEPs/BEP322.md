## 1. Summary

This BEP introduces a suite of interaction process and API specification for boosting mev on BNB Smart Chain.
Participants can follow this specification to collaborate for building and proposing blocks.

## 2. Motivation

While the MEV market for Ethereum is thriving,
[Ethereum Builder API Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs&#41) has been supported by
mainstream consensus clients widely and the inclusion rate of blocks from builders
is [about 90%](https://dune.com/ChainsightAnalytics/mev-after-ethereum-merge&#41) based on the statistics of October
2023,
the BNB Smart Chain MEV market lacks activity. This is attributed to
the absence of the PBS adoption, resulting in a diverse landscape with varied architectures and API standards.
Additionally, different architectures and interface definitions make it challenging for validators to integrate
with multiple MEV providers simultaneously. The lack of BSC client support further impedes stable MEV services.
To address these issues, this BEP proposes compliant guidelines and standards with the following goals:

- **Improve Stability**: Unifying specifications for both validators and MEV providers enhances integration and
  stabilizes the market.

- **Improve Economy**: A unified architectural specification increases speculators' costs, fostering healthy market
  competition.
  Validators can extract more value by integrating with multiple MEV providers, benefiting delegators as well.

- **Improve Transparency**: This specification aims to bring transparency to the BSC MEV market, exposing profit
  distribution among stakeholders to the public.

## 3. Background

Before delving into the specification, let's analyze the BSC trust model and its distinguishing consensus protocol.

### 3.1 BSC Trust Model

Validators in BNB Smart Chain are more trustworthy, requiring substantial BNB delegation and maintaining a high
reputation.
This is in contrast to Ethereum, where becoming a validator is relatively easier.
In BSC, there are about 40 validators (more validators are coming) with 20M BNB staked, including active and inactive
ones. In Ethereum, the barrier to becoming a validator is very low (i.e., 32 ETH), and there are more
than [800 thousand Ethereum validators](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-most-pressing-issue-on-ethereum-is-validator-size-growth).

Meanwhile, the relay role in Ethereum Builder API is supposed to be trusted by both builders and validators.
In BSC, misbehaviour of validators will lead to reputation damage and un-delegations, the necessity of introducing
another trusted role is not that much. In this specification, we don't utilize relay; however, it is still workable to
dd relay between builders and validators.

### 3.2 BSC Consensus

In Ethereum, a block header is passed from a builder to a validator for sign, and then a block can be broadcast to the
network
without revealing the transactions to a validator. Unlike Ethereum, generating a valid block header in BSC involves
executing transactions and system contract calls (e.g., transfer coinbase, deposit to the validator set contract),
making it impossible for builders to broadcast block.

## 4 Workflow

### 4.1 Definition

- **Builder**: party specialized in the construction of ethereum execution payloads using transactions received from
  users and searchers (trusted by searchers and users for fair inclusion)

- **Proposer**: party which signs and submits a beacon block to the network, often referred to as the validator.

- **Mev-sentry**: party who runs in front of a validator to enhance network security and proxy requests.

- **Bid**: used by a builder to do competitive bidding for a block space. A bid should include the following
  information:
    - **parent_hash**. The hash of the parent block.
    - **gas_value**. The gas value of the block.
    - **builder_fee_value**. The fee that builder would like to take.
    - **builder_address**. The address of the builder.

### 4.2 One-round interaction (default)

Builders and validators collaborate to propose blocks during each production interval. Two interaction options exist
between them: one-round and two-round. In one-round, builders include transactions with their bids, allowing validators
to immediately seal a block without additional transaction retrieves. *One-round is the default option for trusted
relationship*.

<img src="./assets/bep-322/workflow_1round.png" alt="workflow" width="500"/>

1) Builder submits bids with transactions to the in-turn validator.
2) Validator picks the max valuable bid from all received bids at proper timing.
3) Validator executes the full transactions and verifies the bid (gas received and expected).
4) If the bid turns to be invalid, the proposer will use local mined block, and also report detailed error to the
   builder.
   The validator would blacklist the builder for some time or forever if the builder offers invalid transactions.
5) Validator seals the final block.

### 4.3 Two-round interaction (optional)

Two-round interaction involves builders sending bids without transactions initially. If selected, validators retrieve
transactions through another RPC call before sealing the block. The two-round process is considered more time-consuming
compared to the one-round interaction. *It's only suggested to adopt two-round interaction for builders who do not fully
trust validator and are not concerned about the additional latency caused by one extra round of communication.*

<img src="./assets/bep-322/workflow_2round.png" alt="workflow" width="500"/>

1) Builder submits bids with transactions to the in-turn validator.
2) Validator picks the max valuable bid from all received bids at proper timing.
3) Validator asks the builder for full transactions if its bid is chosen, and also gives the builder its signature
   as a receipt. The builder should return the full transactions.
4) Validator executes the full transactions and verifies the bid (gas received and expected, illegal transactions
   included or not).
5) If the bid turns to be invalid, the proposer will use local mined block, and also report detailed error to the
   builder.
   The validator would blacklist the builder for some time or forever if the builder offers invalid transactions.
6) Validator seals the final block.

There are some **edge cases** should be elaborated:

- If there is no profitable bid compared to local work, validator should use local mined block.

- In two-round interaction, if the validator cannot receive full transactions before timeout,
  validator should use local mined block too, and do 1) notify the builder using issue api; 2) blacklist the builder for
  a while or even forever.

- If a builder finds that its transactions are stolen by a validator, the builder should 1) refuse to send bids
  to the validator, 2) disclose the steal to public channels for social influences if necessary.

**Two-round with mev-sentry(optional)** interaction:

A mev-sentry can be used for validators to provide several functionalities. The sentry has its own wallet,
which should be different from consensus wallet, and append a transfer transaction to send builder fee.
It can also filter bids and only forward the more profitable ones to a validator. Meanwhile,
for a validator it needs to interact with many builders at the same time, sentry helps to hide validatorâ€™s real IP
information, protecting against DDoS, and so on. Therefore, it is highly suggested for validators to run such a layer
in front of itself in real adoption.

<img src="./assets/bep-322/workflow_2round_proxy.png" alt="workflow" width="1000"/>

After introducing the overall interactions, we would like to highlight some main differences between Ethereum
Builder Specification here for the readers who are familiar with it.

- As mentioned in background, BSC trust model and consensus are different from Ethereum, it is workable for builders to
  send transactions to validators after receiving the receipt signature. In case a builder finds a validator stealing
  transactions, it can 1) not submit bids to evil validators anymore, 2) reveal evidence to the public channels
  (e.g., Discords, Github, blogs) for social influence.

- In Ethereum, the fee settlement between builders and validators is
  conducted using coinbase reward (for reward to builders) and token
  transfer (for fee to validators). In BSC, the coinbase reward will
  be transferred to the system contract for later distribution to
  all delegators. A different way is proposed in this proposal; a
  validator can run a mev-sentry to append transfer transaction for payment.
  It will be further discussed in the later section.

### 4.4 APIs

Following APIs are introduced on Builder and BSC client sides, to
implement the aforementioned workflows. The full specification of these
APIs is defined in [a repo with swagger and smart
contracts](https://github.com/bnb-chain/builder-specs).

#### 4.4.1 Builder APIs

The following APIs should be implemented on Builder.

##### 4.4.1.1 Retrieve Transactions

This api is used by the validator to ask for full transactions once a
builder's bid is chosen. The request body will be treated as a receipt
for payment settlement.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Path</td> 
<td>/bsc/v1/builder/txs</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Http Method</td> 
<td>POST</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Request Body</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
  "message": {
    "block": "height of the block",
    "parent_hash": "the hash of parent block",
    "timestamp": "timestamp",
    "gas_value": "gas value for this block",
    "builder_fee_value": "the fee that builder would like to give",
    "builder_address": "builder address",
    "consensus_address": "validator consensus address",
  },
  "signature": "signature of the message",
  "return_transactions": "the builder should transactions back or not"
}
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Success Response</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
  "message": {
    "timestamp": "timestamp",
    "bid":{
      "block": "height of the block",
      "parent_hash": "the hash of parent block",
      "builder_address": "builder address",
      "gas_value": "gas value for this block",
      "builder_fee_value": "the fee that builder would like to give"
    },
    "transactions": [
      {},
      {},
      {}
    ]
  },
  "signature": "signature of the message"
}
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Error Response</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
  "code": 400,  //example here, there are others
  "message": "response message"
}
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

##### 4.4.1.2 Notify Issues

This api is used to report issues to a builder. For example, if a
validator finds that a builder's transactions are invalid or the txs
api is timeout-ed, a validator can notify the builder.


<table>
<tr>
<td>Path</td> 
<td>/bsc/v1/builder/issue</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Http Method</td> 
<td>POST</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Request Body</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
    "message": {
      "issue_code": "code the predefined issues",
      "timestamp": "timestamp", 
      "consensus_address": "validator consensus address"
    },
    "signature": "signature of the message"
  }
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Success Response</td> 
<td>
HTTP status code is 200
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Error Response</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
  "code": 400,  //example here, there are others
  "message": "response message"
}
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### 4.4.2 Validator APIs

The following APIs should be implemented on the validator side or BSC clients.

##### 4.4.2.1 Bid Block

This api is used by the builder to submit its bid for the current block
production. In general, a proposer will use the `gas_fee` and
`builder_fee_value` (`profit = gas_fee * validator_commission_rate - builder_fee_value`) to
find the most profitable bid.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Path</td> 
<td>/bsc/v1/builder/bid</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Http Method</td> 
<td>POST</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Request Body</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
  "message": {
      "block": "height of the block",
      "parent_hash": "the hash of parent block",
      "timestamp": "timestamp", 
      "builder_address": "builder address",
      "gas_limit": "gas limit",
      "gas_value": "gas value for this block",
      "builder_fee_value": "the fee that builder would like to get",
      "transactions": [ //optional
          {},
          {},
          {}
        ]
  },
  "signature": "signature of the message",
}
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Success Response</td> 
<td>
HTTP status code is 200
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Error Response</td> 
<td>
<pre lang="json">
<code>
{
  "code": 400,  //example here, there are others
  "message": "response message"
}
</code>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## 5. Further Discussion

### 5.1 Implementation Consideration

With a shorter block time of 3 seconds in BSC compared to Ethereum's 12 seconds, designing for time efficiency becomes
crucial.
Validator must set a cut-off time to stop receiving new bids, and a timeout to retrieve transactions from the winning
builder.
To be more flexible, Validator can choose to run a node with or without support for builder, so a switch should be
considered
to turn on/off the feature based on its choice.

<img src="./assets/bep-322/block_timing.png" alt="block_timing" width="500"/>

### 5.2 Payment & Economic Considerations

On BNB Smart Chain, the coinbase reward must be distributed to the block
proposer (i.e., a validator) and transferred to a system contract.
Without changing the consensus rule, these following approaches can be
taken for payment.

For payment from users to builders, off-chain or on-chain solutions can
be considered.

- Users can subscribe to builders' service. For example, users can
  pay builder service every month based on different levels of
  prices.

- Users can insert a transfer transaction into his/her bundles to pay
  the builder.

For the payment between builders and validators:

- A validator can run a proxy and append transfer transactions to pay builders.
  If a validator does not append the transfer transaction, a builder can still
  use the receipt (with validatorâ€™s signature) to ask for settlement using other approaches.

- A validator and a builder can negotiate other off-chain on-chain approaches which are out of scope of the
  specification.

Furthermore, let's also discuss what will happen if a builder or a
validator misbehaves.

- If a builder wins a bid and does not return full transactions to a
  validator, the validator can easily detect this and stop service
  for the builder. Eventually, the builder will get no income from
  block production, consequently users will also leave the builder.

- If a validator steals transactions from a builder when there is
  potential value. The victim builder can detect this and stop
  sending bids to the validator, and also can post evidence (i.e.,
  the signature from a validator) about the misbehavior. The
  validator will lose the income from the builder and even more
  builders.

### 5.3 Builder Registration

The process for builders to register to validators is not defined in this specification.
However, a promising solution is highlighted and suggestedâ€”using a smart contract for builder registration.

In BSC, one smart contract can be implemented to provide the following functionalities:

- a validator can register its information (e.g., consensus address, proxy url) for participation.

- a builder can deposit some amount of BNB for participation.

- a builder can register to validators by providing its information (e.g., builder address).

With this kind of smart contract, builders and validators can discover each other easily.
It also provides transparency for all related stakeholders.
An [example](#5-references) is presented to demonstrate such a smart contract.
