## 1. Summary

This BEP introduces a suite of interaction processes and API specifications to establish a fairer and more transparent
MEV framework on the BNB Smart Chain. Participants can follow this specification to collaborate on building and
proposing blocks.

## 2. Motivation

The Ethereum MEV market is thriving, with
the [Ethereum Builder API Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs&#41) widely supported by
mainstream consensus clients. As of October 2023, the inclusion rate of blocks from builders is
approximately [90%](https://dune.com/ChainsightAnalytics/mev-after-ethereum-merge&#41),
indicating a robust ecosystem.

The BNB Smart Chain MEV market still remains at a Wild West stage. The absence of PBS adoption results in a chaotic
landscape with different architectures and API standards. Nowadays, validators face significant hurdles when attempting
to integrate with multiple MEV providers concurrently. Moreover, the absence of native support from BSC clients further
exacerbates the instability of MEV services. To tackle these issues, this BEP puts forward compliant guidelines and
standards with the following aims:

- **Improve Stability**: Unified specifications for both validators and MEV providers to enhance integration and
  stabilize the market.

- **Improve Economy**: A unified architectural specification increases speculators' costs, fostering a healthy market
  competition. Validators can extract more value by integrating with multiple MEV providers, which benefits delegators
  as well.

- **Improve Transparency**: This specification aims to bring transparency to the BSC MEV market, exposing profit
  distribution among stakeholders to the public.

## 3. Background

Before delving into the specification, let's analyze the BSC trust model and its distinctive consensus protocol.

### 3.1 BSC Trust Model

Validators in the BNB Smart Chain are considered more trustworthy, as they require substantial BNB delegation and must
maintain a high reputation. This stands in contrast to Ethereum, where becoming a validator is relatively easier.
As of the end of 2023, there were approximately 40 validators on BSC (with more expected to join) and a total of
20 million BNB staked. In Ethereum, the barrier to becoming a validator is very low (i.e., 32 ETH), leading to over
800,000 Ethereum validators according
to [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-most-pressing-issue-on-ethereum-is-validator-size-growth).

Meanwhile, in the Ethereum MEV architecture, the 'relay' role is expected to be trusted by both builders and validators.
However, in BSC, validator misbehavior results in reputation damage and un-delegations, reducing the need for
introducing
another trusted role. In this specification, we eliminate the relay role. However, this adjustment should not compromise
the security and trust model for the MEV market between builders and validators.

### 3.2 BSC Consensus

In Ethereum, a block header is transferred from a builder to a validator for signing, allowing the block to be
broadcasted
to the network without disclosing the transactions to the validator. In contrast, in BSC, creating a valid block header
requires executing transactions and system contract calls (such as transferring coinbase and depositing to the validator
set contract), rendering it impossible for builders to broadcast the block.

## 4 Workflow

### 4.1 Definition

- **Builder**: party specialized in the construction of BSC execution payloads using transactions received from
  users and searchers (trusted by searchers and users for fair inclusion).

- **Proposer**: party which signs and submits a block to the network, often referred to as the validator.

- **Mev-sentry**: party who runs in front of a validator to proxy requests and enhance network security.

- **Bid**: used by a builder to do competitive bidding for a block space. A bid should include the following
  information:
    - **block_number**. The height of the block.
    - **parent_hash**. The hash of the parent block.
    - **gas_fee**. The gas fee of the block.
    - **builder_fee**. The fee that builder would like to take.

### 4.2 One-round interaction (default)

Builders and validators collaborate to propose blocks during each production interval. Two interaction options exist
between them: one-round and two-round. In one-round, builders include transactions with their bids, allowing validators
to immediately seal a block without additional transaction retrieves. *One-round is the default option for trusted
relationship*.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/473fb9e9372cbd0fc58d2d58a0e5d79fab1e5552/BEPs/assets/bep-322/workflow_1round.png" alt="workflow" width="500"/>

1) Builder submits bids with transactions to the in-turn validator.
2) Validator picks the max valuable bid from all received bids at proper timing.
3) Validator executes the full transactions and verifies the bid (gas received is the same as in bid, illegal
   transactions included or not).
4) If the bid turns to be invalid, the proposer will use local mined block, and also report detailed error to the
   builder. The validator would blacklist the builder for some time or forever if the builder offers invalid
   transactions.
5) Validator seals the final block.

In practical settings, opting for a **One-round with MEV-Sentry (optional)** configuration stands out as the optimal
solution
for ensuring both security and efficient payment processes. Subsequently, we will delve into the specific role that
MEV-Sentry can fulfill in the upcoming section.

### 4.3 Two-round interaction (optional)

Two-round interaction involves builders sending bids without transactions initially. If selected, validators retrieve
transactions through another RPC call before sealing the block. The two-round process is considered more time-consuming
compared to the one-round interaction. *It's only suggested to adopt two-round interaction for builders who do not fully
trust validator and are not concerned about the additional latency caused by one extra round of communication.*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/473fb9e9372cbd0fc58d2d58a0e5d79fab1e5552/BEPs/assets/bep-322/workflow_2round.png" alt="workflow" width="500"/>

1) Builder submits bids without transactions to the in-turn validator.
2) Validator picks the max valuable bid from all received bids at proper timing.
3) Validator asks the builder for full transactions if its bid is chosen, and also gives the builder its signature
   as a receipt. The builder should return the full transactions.
4) Validator executes the full transactions and verifies the bid (gas received is the same as in bid, illegal
   transactions included or not).
5) If the bid turns to be invalid, the proposer will use local mined block, and also report detailed error to the
   builder.
   The validator would blacklist the builder for some time or forever if the builder offers invalid transactions.
6) Validator seals the final block.

There are some **edge cases** should be elaborated:

- If there is no profitable bid compared to local work, validator should use local mined block.

- In two-round interaction, if the validator cannot receive full transactions before timeout,
  validator should use local mined block too, and do 1) notify the builder using issue api; 2) blacklist the builder for
  a while or even forever.

- If a builder finds that its transactions are stolen by a validator, the builder should 1) refuse to send bids
  to the validator, 2) disclose the steal to public channels for social influences if necessary.

**Two-round with mev-sentry(optional)** interaction:

A mev-sentry can be used for validators to provide several functionalities. The sentry has its own wallet,
which should be different from consensus wallet, and append a transfer transaction to send builder fee.
It can also filter bids and only forward the more profitable ones to a validator. Meanwhile,
for a validator it needs to interact with many builders at the same time, sentry helps to hide validatorâ€™s real IP
information, protecting against DDoS, and so on. Therefore, it is highly suggested for validators to run such a layer
in front of itself in real adoption.

After introducing the overall interactions, we would like to highlight some main differences between Ethereum
Builder Specification here for the readers who are familiar with it.

- As mentioned in background, BSC trust model and consensus are different from Ethereum, it is workable for builders to
  send transactions to validators after receiving the receipt signature. In case a builder finds a validator stealing
  transactions, it can 1) not submit bids to evil validators anymore, 2) reveal evidence to the public channels
  (e.g., Discords, Github, blogs) for social influence.

- In Ethereum, the fee settlement between builders and validators is conducted using coinbase reward (for reward to
  builders)
  and token transfer (for fee to validators). In BSC, the coinbase reward will be transferred to the system contract for
  later distribution to all delegators. A different way is proposed in this proposal, a validator can run a mev-sentry
  to
  append transfer transaction for payment. It will be further discussed in the later section.

### 4.4 APIs

Following APIs are introduced on Builder and BSC client sides, to implement the aforementioned workflows.
The full specification of these APIs is defined
in [a repo with swagger and smart contracts](https://github.com/bnb-chain/builder-specs).

#### 4.4.1 Builder APIs

The following APIs should be implemented on Builder.

##### 4.4.1.1 Notify Issues

This api is used to report issues to a builder. For example, if a validator finds that a builder's transactions are
invalid or the gas fee is wrong and so on, a validator can notify the builder.

Request:

```json
{
	"jsonrpc":"2.0",
	"method":"mev_reportIssue",
	"params": [{
	    "validator": "validator address",
	    "bidHash": "hash of the bid",
	    "error": {
	        "code": -38001,
	        "message": "response message"
	    }
	}],
	"id":1
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "result": null,
    "id":1
}
```

#### 4.4.2 Validator APIs

The following APIs should be implemented on the validator side or BSC clients.

##### 4.4.2.1 Bid Block

This api is used by the builder to submit its bid for the current block production. In general, a proposer will use the
`gas_fee` and `builder_fee_value` (`profit = gas_fee * validator_commission_rate - builder_fee_value`) to find the most
profitable bid.

Request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "mev_sendBid",
  "params": [
    {
      "bid": {
        "block_number": 123456,
        "parent_hash": "the hash of the parent block",
        "txs": [
          "the transactions in the bid"
        ],
        "gasUsed": 100,
        "gasFee": 100000000000,
        "builderFee": 100000000000
      },
      "signature": "the signature of the bid"
    }
  ],
  "id": 64
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "the bid hash",
  "id": 64
}
```

## 5. Further Discussion

### 5.1 Implementation Consideration

With a shorter block time of 3 seconds in BSC compared to Ethereum's 12 seconds, designing for time efficiency becomes
crucial. Validator must set a cut-off time to stop receiving new bids, and a timeout to retrieve transactions from
the winning builder. To be more flexible, Validator can choose to run a node with or without support for builder, 
so a switch should be considered to turn on/off the feature based on its choice.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/473fb9e9372cbd0fc58d2d58a0e5d79fab1e5552/BEPs/assets/bep-322/block_timing.png" alt="block_timing" width="500"/>

### 5.2 Payment & Economic Considerations

A part of BSC's consensus protocol operates as follows: Block proposers initiate transactions by transferring block
rewards to the validator set contract. During the breathing block at midnight each day, block rewards are distributed to
delegators and validators based on the staked amounts. **This distribution mechanism is also applicable to MEV income.**

Without changing bsc consensus rule, these following approaches can be taken for the payment from users to builders,
off-chain or on-chain solutions can be considered:

- Users can subscribe to builders' service. For example, users can pay builder service every month based on different 
  levels of prices.

- Users can insert a transfer transaction into his/her bundles to pay the builder.

For the payment between builders and validators:

- A validator can run a proxy and append transfer transactions to pay builders. If a validator does not append the 
  transfer transaction, a builder can still use the receipt (with validatorâ€™s signature) to ask for settlement using 
  other approaches.

- A validator and a builder can negotiate other off-chain/on-chain approaches which are out of scope of the specification.

Furthermore, let's also discuss what will happen if a builder or a validator misbehaves.

- If a builder wins a bid and does not return full transactions to a validator, the validator can easily detect this 
  and stop service for the builder. Eventually, the builder will get no income from block production, consequently users 
  will also leave the builder.

- If a validator steals transactions from a builder when there is potential value. The victim builder can detect this 
  and stop sending bids to the validator, and also can post evidence (i.e., the signature from a validator) about the 
  misbehavior. The validator will lose the income from the builder and even more builders.

### 5.3 Builder Registration

While this specification doesn't detail the registration process for builders with validators, it does propose a 
promising solution: employing a smart contract for builder registration. In BSC, one smart contract can be implemented
to provide the following functionalities:

- a validator can register its information (e.g., consensus address, proxy url) for participation.
- a builder can deposit some amount of BNB for participation.
- a builder can register to validators by providing its information (e.g., builder address).

With this kind of smart contract, builders and validators can discover each other easily. It also provides transparency 
for all related stakeholders. An [example](#6-references) is presented to demonstrate such a smart contract.
